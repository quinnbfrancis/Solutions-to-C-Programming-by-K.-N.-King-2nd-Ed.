    n=0;
    if (n>=1<=10)
        printf("n is between 1 and 10/n");

It is legal, but flawed because of the left associativity that equality operators have. It will test whether n(0) >= 1 or not (in this case it's false(0)) and then test whether 0<=10 which is true, meaning the that the if query would be answered true and the printf statement would execute.
