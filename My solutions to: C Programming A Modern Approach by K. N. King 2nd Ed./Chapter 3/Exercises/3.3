#include <stdio.h>
int main (void)
{
    float a;
    scanf("%f ", &a);
    printf("%f", a);
}
/*
 
 a) "%d" vs " %d"
    same because scanf ignores white space characters
 
 b) "%d-%d-%d" vs "%d -%d -%d"
    same because scanf ignores white space characters
 
 c) "%f" vs "%f "
    Different because the white space character at the end of the second format string would mean that a white space character would need to be inputted after the floating point number in order for the program to continue
 
 d) "%f,%f" vs "%f, %f"
    same because scanf ignores white space characters
